# Assignment-1

In this assignment you will implement a number of common sort algorithms and compare their
performance for different input files. You will also write JUnit tests to test your code.
Total points for this assignment: 200 (100 automatic, 100 marked by demonstrators)
The following will be marked:
1. Correctness of your results (eg items are sorted), JUnit tests, and test code coverage –
automatic mark through web-cat, 100 points
2. Correct implementation of sort algorithms (eg your MergeSort method implements merge
sort rather than another kind of sort) and results of running time comparisons – marked by
demonstrators, 100 points
